# robotex82/itsf_fund_reports

A ruby translation project managed on [Locale](http://www.localeapp.com/) that's open to all!

## Contributing to robotex82/itsf_fund_reports

- Edit the translations directly on the [robotex82/itsf_fund_reports](http://www.localeapp.com/projects/public?search=robotex82/itsf_fund_reports) project on Locale.
- **That's it!**
- The maintainer will then pull translations from the Locale project and push to Github.

Happy translating!
